# Create a pod based on a file (just like the Pods section)
oc create -f pods/pod.yaml

# Create a service for the pod
oc expose --port 8080 pod/hello-world-pod

# Check that the service and pod are connected properly
oc status

# Create another pod
oc create -f pods/pod2.yaml

# Shell into the second pod
oc rsh hello-world-pod-2

# Get the service IP and Port
oc status

# In the shell, you can make a request to the service (because you are inside the OpenShift cluster)
wget -qO- <service IP / Port>
