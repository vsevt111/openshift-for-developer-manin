# Use S2I in a build
# The syntax is the same as normal Builds. OpenShift uses S2I when there is no Dockerfile

# oc new-app works with S2I 
oc new-app <Git URL with no Dockerfile>

# oc new-build works with S2I 
oc new-build <Git URL with no Dockerfile>

# Example: build the s2i/ruby directory of the labs project
oc new-app https://gitlab.com/practical-openshift/labs.git \
  --context-dir s2i/ruby


# Specifying a builder image
oc new-app builder-image~<Git URL>

# Example: Deploy with the ruby image explicitly declared
oc new-app \
  ruby~https://gitlab.com/practical-openshift/labs.git \
  --context-dir s2i/ruby


# Overriding S2I Scripts
# Assemble and Run are the two main scripts
# Overrides go in your source at .s2i/bin/assemble or .s2i/bin/run
# They need to call the original scripts, which are usually at /usr/libexec/s2i/assemble or /usr/libexec/s2i/run
